Pushing my completed &amp; on going projects created using the technology Html, Css &amp; JS

This project is designed to help you practice DOM manipulation, form handling, and basic calculations in JavaScript. I've created a temperature converter that allows users to enter a temperature value, select the unit they want to convert from, and select the unit they want to convert to. The “Convert” button should only be enabled when all three fields are filled in. Once the user clicks “Convert,” the tool will display the converted temperature below the form.
